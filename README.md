# URL-Shortener-in-Python

It's a small project for my personal use.

## Why did I build this?
Usually I share a lot of links with my friends on social networks and I don't want to send them a huge text message with a link.
So I decided to build something like this for everyday use.

## What did I use when I created this app?
- Since I used **_[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)_** before (Projects where I used **Fask** [TimeTravelers](https://github.com/byradu/TimeTRAVELERS-WEB) and one private project that I can share if you request ) I've also decided to use it here. 
- **_[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)_** is also present here.
- **_[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)_** is the engine template that I used for rendering the shoter link and last 10 link that were generated.
